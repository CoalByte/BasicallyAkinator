# BasicallyAkinator
Basically Akinator, written in Python.

This is a program based on [Akinator](https://en.akinator.com/), which basically guesses who/what you are thinking about based on some key characteristics.

Every line has a comment explaining what it does If you don't really get how the code works.

Feel free to contribute to this project as It's pretty new, open a request and I'Il merge it if It looks good.
